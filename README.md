Disclaimer:
Creating a full-fledged Quran recitation app with audio playback, user interface, and offline functionality in Python would require a significant amount of development effort and specific libraries. However, we can provide a basic Python script that demonstrates how to play an audio file of a Quran recitation, which could be a starting point for a more complex application.
Basic Python Script for Quran Recitation Playback:
import pygame

def play_quran_recitation(audio_file_path):
    """
    Plays a Quran recitation audio file.

    Args:
        audio_file_path (str): The path to the audio file.
    """

    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.mixer.music.load(audio_file_path)
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

    while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():
        pygame.time.Clock().tick(10)

# Replace 'quran_recitation.mp3' with the actual path to your audio file
audio_file = "quran_recitation.mp3"
play_quran_recitation(audio_file)

Explanation:
 * Import Pygame: This library is used for handling multimedia tasks like playing audio.
 * Initialize Pygame: This step initializes the Pygame module.
 * Load Audio: The pygame.mixer.music.load() function loads the specified audio file.
 * Play Audio: The pygame.mixer.music.play() function starts playing the loaded audio.
 * Wait for Playback: The while loop keeps the script running until the audio finishes playing.
Additional Considerations for a Full-Fledged App:
 * User Interface: You'll need a GUI framework like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy to create a user-friendly interface.
 * Audio Library: Consider using a more advanced audio library like PyDub for more granular control over audio processing.
 * Offline Functionality: If you want to allow users to listen to recitations offline, you'll need to download the audio files and store them locally.
 * Quran Text Display: You can display the Quranic text along with the recitation, potentially using a library like PyMuPDF to render PDF files containing the Quran.
 * Quranic Features: Implement features like bookmarking, searching, and translation.
 * Database: Use a database to store user preferences, bookmarks, and other data.
 * Mobile App Development: For a mobile app, consider using frameworks like Kivy or frameworks specific to Android (Kotlin/Java) or iOS (Swift).
Remember:
 * Obtain Legal Audio Files: Ensure you have the necessary rights to distribute the Quranic recitations.
 * Respect Copyright Laws: Adhere to copyright laws and licensing terms when using audio files and other resources.
 * User Experience: Design a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
 * Performance Optimization: Optimize your code for efficient audio playback and UI responsiveness.
By combining these elements and leveraging the power of Python, you can create a robust and feature-rich Quran recitation app.
